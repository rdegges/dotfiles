# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles, managed by [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io).


## Usage

To use these, you must do a few things first:

- Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
- Install Git
- Upload a new SSH key to GitHub (so you can use SSH for this repo)
- Install [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh)
- Install chezmoi

Finally, you'll want to run:

```bash
chezmoi init --apply git@github.com:rdegges/dotfiles.git
```


## Bootstrap

To bootstrap all of the steps above, I've simplified it into a quick script you can run here.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rdegges/dotfiles/main/bootstrap.sh)"
```
